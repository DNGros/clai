#
# Configuration file for the 'howdoi' CLAI skill
#
# Each section in this configuration file denotes a specific 'search provider'.
# Search providers will be searched in the order in which they are encountered
# here.
#
# There is one required and three optional parameters per section:
#
#   api [REQUIRED]
#       URL for the RESTful search provider
#
#   variants
#       A space-separated list of "search variants", as some search providers
#       provide support for different database searches.  The order in which the
#       variants are listed here is the order in which they will be searched.
#       If no "variants" line is supplied, the search provider will use its
#       default search database.
#
#       For example: the IBM KnowledgeCenter uses a collection of IBM
#       publications as its default search database, but also contains
#       databases for searching DeveloperWorks, Redbooks, Technotes, and others.
#
#   exclude
#       A space-separated list of client operating systems for which the search
#       provider is ignored.  For example: a search provider containing the
#       line:
#           exclude=Linux Darwin
#       will be ignored when the CLAI client is Linux or MacOSX.
#
#       Valid exclude values are "Linux", "Darwin", and "OS/390".
